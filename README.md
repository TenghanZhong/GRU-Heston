# 📌 **Hybrid ETF Option Pricing Model: Heston + GRU**  

This repository provides a **comprehensive end-to-end pipeline** for **ETF option pricing**, integrating the **Heston stochastic volatility model** with a **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network** to improve pricing accuracy. By leveraging **high-frequency time series data**, the model dynamically corrects traditional pricing errors, enhancing market efficiency and prediction reliability.

## 🔹 **Project Overview**  

Traditional option pricing models, such as **Black-Scholes** and **Heston**, often struggle to fully capture the complex, non-linear nature of **high-frequency ETF option prices**. This project proposes a **hybrid correction framework**, where a **GRU model** learns and adjusts for pricing deviations in real-time.  

### 🔹 **Key Contributions:**  
✔️ **Data cleaning and preprocessing of high-frequency option & ETF spot price data**  
✔️ **Using high frequency data for parameter calibration of Heston model via WMSE minimization**  
✔️ **Error correction using GRU to refine pricing estimates dynamically**  
✔️ **Integration of deep learning to enhance traditional financial model**

## 🚀 **Workflow**  

### **1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Collects **high-frequency ETF option data** via **Tushare API**  
- Merges **ETF spot prices** and computes **time-to-maturity (TTM)**  
- Estimates **risk-free rates (Rf)** using **linear interpolation on SHIBOR**  

### **2️⃣ Heston Model Calibration**  
- Uses **Trust-Region Reflective (TRR) algorithm** to optimize the **five Heston parameters**  
- Minimizes **Weighted Mean Squared Error (WMSE)** between **Heston prices and market prices**  

### **3️⃣ Bias Extraction & Normalization**  
- Computes **pricing errors** between Heston estimates and real market prices  
- Applies **min-max normalization** to handle the **non-Gaussian distribution** of errors  

### **4️⃣ GRU Model Training**  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** via **grid search & 10-fold cross-validation**  
- Trains GRU on the **last 60 minutes of error sequences** to capture temporal dependencies  

### **5️⃣ Pricing Correction & Refinement**  
- Predicts **next-minute error (t+1) based on the past hour’s data**  
- Corrects the **Heston price estimate** by adding **GRU-predicted deviations**  
- Produces a **refined ETF option price at minute-level granularity**

## 📈 **Results & Performance**  

✔️ The **hybrid Heston-GRU model** significantly **reduces pricing errors**, achieving:  
- **More accurate** ETF option pricing at a high-frequency level  
- **Enhanced generalization** compared to traditional pricing models  
- **Greater robustness** in handling market volatility and nonlinear dependencies
